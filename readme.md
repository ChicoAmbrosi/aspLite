## Developer framework for Single Page Applications in classic ASP/VBScript

aspLite is a framework for ASP/VBScript developers. It can help to develop modern (Ajax) and good looking (Bootstrap) ASP/VBScript applications. 

aspLite does not rely or require any 3rd party DLL to be installed along with the codebase and therefore works on each and every (shared) Windows hosting solution.
